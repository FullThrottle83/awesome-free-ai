2. **One tool per pull request:** Submit each suggestion separately.
3. **Alphabetize:** Place the new entry in alphabetical order within its category.
4. **Format your entry like this:**

```
- [Tool Name](https://example.com/) - Brief, objective description.
    - **Free Tier Details:** Be specific (“10,000 chars/mo”, “Unlimited with watermark”).
    - **Tags:** `open-source`, `commercial-use`, `api`, etc.
```

- Descriptions should start with a capital letter, end with a period, and avoid hype or marketing language.
- Free tier details must be explicit.
